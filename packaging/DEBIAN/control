Description: Always-listening voice dictation with modular state machine architecture
 Atlas Voice provides hands-free voice dictation using OpenWakeWord
 for wake word detection and OpenAI Whisper for transcription.
 .
 Say "Hey Atlas" to activate, dictate your text, and say "break"
 to finish. Text is automatically typed into the focused application.
 .
 v2.0.0 is a complete architectural rewrite — the monolithic atlas.py
 has been replaced with 14 focused modules built around a finite state
 machine with thread-safe mailbox IPC.
 .
 Features:
  - Custom trained "Hey Atlas" wake word
  - GPU-accelerated Whisper large-v3 transcription
  - 5-state finite state machine (disabled/paused/listening/recording/transcribing)
  - Continuous dictation with overlapping speech detection
  - Console & GUI typing modes (switchable by voice command)
  - Terminal safety — clipboard paste instead of typing in terminals
  - System tray icon with pause/resume/disable controls
  - Audio health monitoring with auto-restart
  - Spoken punctuation support (45+ configurable rules)
  - External settings.conf for all configuration
 .
 System requirements:
  - NVIDIA GPU with 4GB+ VRAM (CUDA acceleration)
  - ~6GB disk space (2.5GB venv + 3GB Whisper model)
  - Working microphone
  - Desktop environment with system tray support
 .
 All Python dependencies are bundled in an isolated virtual environment.
 The Whisper large-v3 model (~3GB) is downloaded automatically from
 huggingface.co/Systran during installation.
