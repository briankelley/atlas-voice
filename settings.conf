# Audio input device name for matching. Leave blank to use system default.
#
# Matching rules:
#   1. Exact match against device name is tried first
#   2. If no exact match, case-insensitive substring match is used
#   3. If multiple devices match substring, an error is raised listing matches
#   4. Only input-capable devices (max_input_channels > 0) are considered
#
# The name comes from sounddevice's device name field. On Windows (WASAPI),
# Linux (ALSA/PulseAudio), and macOS (CoreAudio) these may differ slightly.
#
# To list available input devices with index, name, and host API:
#   python3 -c "import sounddevice as sd; devs = sd.query_devices(); print('\n'.join(f'  [{i}] {d[\"name\"]} (hostapi={d[\"hostapi\"]}, in={d[\"max_input_channels\"]})' for i, d in enumerate(devs) if d['max_input_channels'] > 0))"

# Examples:
#   device = 1080p Pro Stream Webcam
#   device = USB Audio Device
#   device =
